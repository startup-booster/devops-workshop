# DevOps Workshop - "Hello World!"

Welcome to the DevOps workshop.

The purpose of this task is to guide you through the process of creating your own Docker image that displays a "Hello World!" message when run as a container. By completing this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience in writing a simple Dockerfile, building a custom image, and running a container locally.

#### Prerequisites:
* Docker installed on your local machine. Follow the official Docker installation guide: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

### Steps:

1. Build an app that displays "Hello World!" in the web browser. The app can be written in any language or using any tool of your choice.

2. Create a Dockerfile and add your build instructions there. Avoid copying unnecessary files into the image.

3. Build the "hello-world" Docker image

4. Tag the Docker image with the tag "jellyfish"

5. Run the Docker Container on port 6666

6. Open the web browser on port 6666 and verify the output

### Key notes:

#### Don't pull the hello-world official Docker image, that counts as cheating!
